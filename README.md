# Halma
Projects for course IF3170 Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction

This halma game is done as part of completing the course IF3170 Artificial Intelligence in 
Institut Teknologi Bandung. The core of the project is implementing AI in the bot (computer player),
using Minimax Algorithm, Local Search Algorithms (Hill Climbing or Simulated Annealing), and both, 
and finding out how good each algorithm performs.

The app is web-based, and written in vanilla HTML + CSS + Javascript.
